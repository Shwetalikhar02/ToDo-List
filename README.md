By completing this To-Do List Web App task using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, I have gained practical experience with essential web development concepts. It builds my skills.
Here, I have described what I have learned and how can implement in the task:

HTML Structure & Semantic Elements, CSS Styling, Javascript Fundamentals:

HTML Structure-
Creating structured layouts (using <div>, <input>, <button>).
Understanding the role of semantic tags for accessibility and readability.

CSS Styling- 
Styling layouts using Flexbox for alignment and spacing.
Using classes and IDs to target elements.
Enhancing UI with colors, borders, padding, hover effects, and box shadows.
Making my app visually appealing and user-friendly.

JavaScript Fundamentals-
DOM Manipulation: Accessing and modifying HTML elements dynamically. 
Using document.getElementById() and document.createElement().

Event Handling: 
Adding click event listeners to buttons and list items.
Using addEventListener() to respond to user actions.
Class Toggling: Applying styles conditionally (like marking a task as complete).
Element Removal: Implementing dynamic deletion of tasks from the list.
Form Handling: Managing user input and resetting the input field after use.

Problem Solving & Debugging-
Encountering and fixing bugs while building logic (e.g., handling empty input, stopping event bubbling).
Learning how to test small parts of the app to isolate problems.

Project Structuring-
Separating concerns into different files: index.html, style.css, and script.js.
Writing clean, readable, and maintainable code.
